<p>From 1-Aug-1993, each newly-listed company was required to have 2 INEDs. 
Existing companies had to have 1 INED by 1-Jul-1994 and 2 INEDs by 31-Dec-1994, 
although they were sometimes hard to spot, as the company didn't have to say 
which directors it considered to be INEDs until 2003. 
The quota was increased to 3 INEDs on 30-Sep-2004, when the definition of independence 
was also 
changed to exclude those who provide professional advisory services to 
the issuer (but not bankers), and at least 1 of the 3 must have financial or 
accounting expertise. In addition, since 31-Dec-2012, INEDs 
<a href="http://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/rulesreg/listrules/mbrulesup/mb_rupdate28_cover.htm" target="_blank">must constitute</a> at least one 
third of the board. However, most companies have fewer than 10 
directors, so the latter requirement has no effect for them. Controlling 
shareholders <a href="../articles/3wisemonkeys.asp">can still vote</a> on all 
the INED elections.</p>
