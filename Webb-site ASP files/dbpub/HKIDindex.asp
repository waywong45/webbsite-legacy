<h2 style="text-align:center">The HKID index: service suspended<br/>
A special message from our Founder<br/>
<span class="headlinedate">15th February 2013</span></h2>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>Webb-site has this evening received an e-mail letter from Hong Kong&#39;s
<a href="http://www.pcpd.org.hk" target="_blank">Privacy Commissioner for 
Personal Data</a> (<strong>PCPD</strong>), stating that it has read newspaper 
reports about the Webb-site HKID Index and is &quot;duty bound to examine any possible 
contravention of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance&quot; (<strong>PDPO</strong>). 
The PCPD has also been briefing members of the media about its enquiries and 
theories.</p>
<p>Our first, internal reaction was &quot;are you serious? For information that anyone 
could legally have found online?&quot;.</p>
<p>Webb-site always acts lawfully. All of the information in our database comes 
from public sources and has therefore been previously disclosed.
<a href="../dbpub" target="_blank">Webb-site Who&#39;s Who</a> (<strong>WWW</strong>) covers all 
HK-listed companies and their directors since 1990 (painstakingly extracted from 
annual reports), all members of the 
Government&#39;s statutory and advisory bodies, the Executive Council, the 
Legislative Council, the District Councils and the Election Committee, amongst 
others, including relationships between them and their families where publicly known. There are now 
over 100,000 people in WWW, plus basic information (not from behind the pay-wall) 
on every company registered in Hong Kong since records began in 1865, and much 
more besides.</p>
<p>All of this aims to increase transparency and accountability, and to reduce 
corruption, corporate fraud, money-laundering, identity fraud and other 
activities which are facilitated by a lack of transparency, to make 
conflicts of interests easier to find, and people&#39;s interests in general easier 
to understand.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, the WWW database avoids mistaken identity. The use of a 
unique identifier, such as a government-issued ID number or passport number, 
substantially reduces mistaken identity, so we include those in the database 
when they are already in the public domain. This will help reduce confusion with 
other individuals who share the same name and are in WWW now or in the future. 
Such a number is merely an identifier and does not convey information
<span class="style1">about</span> a person.</p>
<p>It would enormously help transparency in the corporate and government world 
if companies, the Government and other organisations would publish the unique, 
lifelong Hong Kong Identity number assigned to an individual when appointing 
them to statutory boards and committees or granting them a license as an estate 
agent, accountant, SFC-licensee, HKMA-licensee and so on. Then we could all 
be sure who they are talking about, rather than wondering <span class="style1">
which</span> &quot;Chan Chi Keung&quot; or &quot;Yang Bin&quot; has been appointed. 
ID numbers <a href="../articles/identity2.asp">should not be regarded as secrets</a> 
- they are just more accurate identifiers than names. They tell you virtually 
nothing about a person - they are identifiers, not personal data.</p>
<h3>No sense</h3>
<p>We do not collect data from individuals, and have therefore never needed to 
seek their consent. WWW could have been produced from any country in the world 
using the internet. It goes against common sense to suggest, as PCPD does, that anyone who 
records publicly available information is breaching the PDPO, or that they 
should not be able to record that information in their own publication.</p>
<p>It would 
mean that financial web sites such as Bloomberg or Reuters, with lists of 
directors, including personal data such as their biographies, ages and relationships to each other, or 
including records of their share dealings and earnings as directors, would be 
breaching the PDPO if they did not have the consent of the director. All of that 
is personal information, but it is also public information. It would 
also mean that online movie databases with Hong Kong actors&#39; dates of birth and known 
relationships would be breaching the PDPO. It would also mean that chunks of 
Wikipedia, with birth dates of Hong Kong public figures and their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_big_families_of_Hong_Kong#Li_family_notables" target="_blank">
family trees</a>, would be breaching the PDPO. And finally, it would mean that 
Google itself is breaching the PDPO by holding copies of the data and indexing 
them so that we can all find it.</p>
<p>We regard the investigation by the PCPD as wholly misconceived and a threat 
to the freedom of speech and publication guaranteed by
<a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_3.html" target="_blank">
Article 27 of the Basic Law</a>.</p>
<p>For the first time in many years, probably since our early coverage of
<a href="../articles/kroll.asp">the Cyberport</a>, we feel threatened in our 
coverage of HK affairs.</p>
<p>Despite this, Webb-site is not-for-profit and although I heavily subsidize 
its running costs and commit a great deal of my time to promote transparency, accountability, 
and good governance in Hong Kong, I am not willing to commit vast amounts 
of money to a protracted legal court challenge of these principles against the 
virtually unlimited 
resources of the Government.</p>
<p>Accordingly, with immediate effect, the Webb-site HKID index is indefinitely suspended. We will respond to the PCPD&#39;s questions in due course, and seek to convince 
them that transparency of public data, and the freedom to collate it, is both 
legal and in the 
public interest. If the index never returns, you will know why.</p>
<p>If you want 
to know the exact identity of company directors, liquidators, bail-jumpers and others who were 
included in the index, you can hit
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Hong+Kong+identity%22+site%3Asec.gov" target="_blank">this link</a> to search Google for HKIDs in the US SEC documents, or
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HKID+site:gld.gov.hk" target="_blank">this link</a> to search Google for the Gazette notices for HKIDs, or
<a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=HKIC+site:icac.org.hk" target="_blank">
this link</a> to search Google for the ICAC web site. There are 
other sources of course. For an 
individual, just Google various arrangements of their full names (inside double 
quotes) and the word &quot;HKID&quot; (to avoid the Google mistyping assumption of &quot;kid&quot;), 
and you will find most of them.</p>
<p>A Supreme Court Justice once said that &quot;Sunlight is the best disinfectant&quot;. 
This has been a dark day for transparency in Hong Kong.</p>
