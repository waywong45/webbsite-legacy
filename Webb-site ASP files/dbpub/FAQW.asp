<h3>1. <a name="privacy"></a>Does Webb-site Reports breach privacy laws?</h3>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>All of the articles on Webb-site are reports of public 
information, or if we are reporting breaking news (information not already 
available), then it is information which there is a legitimate 
public interest in reporting, just like any other media entity, including newspapers, magazines, 
radio or TV, whether online or offline.</p>
<h3><a name="deletion"></a>2. Will you delete published reports?</h3>
<p>
No.
<a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_3.html" target="_blank">Article 
27</a> of the Basic Law, Hong Kong&#39;s constitution, protects freedom of speech, 
of the press and of publication. It is a key element of the rule of law, and one 
of Hong Kong&#39;s greatest assets.</p>
<p>Our policy is that if information has been legally published and we have 
reported it on Webb-site, then we will not delete it or redact it, 
because that would leave some members of the public (including us) with 
legally-obtained information that others do not have, unless they can find it in 
other media archives.</p>
<p>For example, if a law enforcement agency issues a media release 
naming people charged with or convicted of offences, then the facts of the 
charge or conviction enter the public domain. The purpose of the media release 
is publication so that it may be read and reported, and reporting it on Webb-site or other media has the same 
purpose. A person does of course remain 
innocent unless proven guilty.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a published court ruling names the 
parties, or contains information from which the parties are identifiable, or 
they are otherwise known, then (in the absence of an injunction) 
we and other media are entitled to report it and to archive our reports. In another example, if a law requires that 
filings of political donations are made available to the public, then we will 
not delete them even if they are no longer available from the source.</p>
<p>This policy applies even if the source subsequently 
redacts its own archives. Newspapers and other 
online media may have reported the same information, in which case the information will 
remain in their archives, and in ours. Copies of original media releases and 
judgments can often be found in libraries, online or offline, and often in 
search engine caches and internet archives. It is simply impractical to try to 
reverse the arrow of time and withdraw published information into an 
&quot;unpublished&quot; state, removing it from every archive or library, deleting it from 
human knowledge, or forbidding the repetition of it, whether online or in 
person. We will not create Orwellian
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole" target="_blank">memory holes</a>. It is true that the internet has made published information more 
accessible than ever before. That is not a reason to censor it.</p>
<p>However, if information has been <em>illegally </em>published (for example, 
an illegally-uploaded bank file in a security breach), then unless there is an 
outweighing public interest, we would not report 
it in the 
first place. Examples of an outweighing public interest include, but are not 
limited to, situations in which the information exposes wrong-doing or conflicts 
of interest. Examples might include a corruption payment, or a hidden 
related-party interest in a corporate transaction.</p>
<h3>3. <a name="error"></a>How do I report an error in your reports?</h3>
<p>We welcome reports of errors for correction. Just <a href="../contact">click 
here</a> to fill in the form, and please provide as much information as 
possible, including links to any source material.</p>
<h3><a name="where"></a>4. Where is Webb-site Reports published?</h3>
<p>You are reading Webb-site Reports delivered to you from a server in Chicago, USA, and 
it is accessible in all good countries and territories via the internet. Our 
occasional newsletter is published from the same place. We edit 
the publication from Hong Kong, but we could just as easily do so from many 
other places.</p>
