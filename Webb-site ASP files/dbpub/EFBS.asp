<h2><%=title%></h2>
<p>This page shows items from the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund (<strong>EF</strong>) 
of the <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</a> (<strong>HKMA</strong>), updated monthly. As 
the HKSAR Government places most of its fiscal reserves with the EF, we can see 
the drawdown during the Coronavirus pandemic and other times since 1996, as well 
as the changes in the banking system's aggregate balance.</p>
<p>The default view shows "Fiscal reserves+equity", which is the sum of the 
Government's fiscal 
(tax) reserves and the equity, or accumulated gains, of the EF, which are mostly 
available to the Government, as the EF only needs a small buffer to ensure that 
the currency board or "USD-HKD peg" will have sufficient assets to cover its 
liabilities.</p>
<p>A further amount, "HKSARG funds &amp; statutory bodies" includes the 
Bond Fund (amounts set aside for repayment of Government bonds) as well as money 
held for bodies such as the Research Endowment Fund, Housing Authority and 
Hospital Authority. Various amounts have been expensed in the HKSARG budget and 
placed into these dedicated silos over the years.</p>
<p>"Certificates of indebtedness" are amounts due to the 3 note-issuing banks 
which in turn issue bank notes (excluding the HK$10 note issued by the HKMA).
