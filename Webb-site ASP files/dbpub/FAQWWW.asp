<h3 id="U">1. What does code &quot;U&quot; mean?</h3>
<p>In Webb-site Database, &quot;U&quot; in the Officers, Advisers or Adviserships 
tables means the person no longer holds that position but we do not know when the 
person ceased to hold the position.</p>
<h3 id="fromuntil">2. What do the &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Until&quot; dates mean?</h3>
<p>For positions, we use the right-open interval convention for time periods, which means that 
the period includes the &quot;from&quot; date but excludes the &quot;until&quot; date. The until 
date is the first date on which the person no longer holds a position. The 
reason we use this convention is that it makes it easier to see who replaced a 
person, by matching a departing person's &quot;until&quot; date with an incoming person's 
&quot;from&quot; date. It also makes it easier to see when a person has changed 
position in an organisation, as the two dates will match. For directorships, the 
&quot;Until&quot; date is the date of resignation, removal or death.</p>
<p>If a person's appointment or resignation date is not known exactly, 
then we record the nearest month or year, and our site only shows what we know.</p>
<p>If an &quot;until&quot; date is in the future, then it is the date on which the term of 
appointment is expected to expire. This is most common for government 
appointments to statutory or advisory bodies.</p>
<h3 id="returns">3. What is total return and CAGR?</h3>
<p>The total return is the Webb-site Total Return on the ordinary shares of 
	the company over the period in which the person holds or held the position, 
or since 3-Jan-1994 if the directorship began earlier. 
	For more information on the calculation, see the <a href="leagueNotesD.asp">
notes on Webb-site Director League Tables</a> and the <a href="TRnotes.asp">notes on Webb-site Total 
Returns</a>. The Compound Annualised Growth Rate (CAGR) is the annualised rate 
	of return.</p>
<h3 id="accurate">4. Are the data guaranteed to be accurate?</h3>
<p>No, but we try our best. Unfortunately, when published sources name individuals, they do not 
always <i>identify</i> them. To identify them would be to provide enough 
information to be 100% certain of the exact person to whom the name refers. It 
is very rare for sources to publish a unique identifier, such as an ID card 
number, which would allow us to be certain (assuming that an index of ID cards 
was available for verification). All we can do is make all reasonable efforts to 
avoid the two main types of error: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>multiple identity</b>, where the same person has more than one 
	identifier in our database; and</li>
	<li><b>mistaken identity</b>, where the identifier in our database refers to 
	more than one person</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple identity usually arises because the person has used variations of 
his or her name in different instances - for example, using a married name 
rather than a maiden name. Mistaken identity usually arises where two sources 
use the same name and in such similar contexts that we have assumed them to be 
the same person. We attempt to distinguish between them by reference to age, 
gender and any other biographical information we can find. That is why, if you 
search for common names in our database, you will sometimes find a year number 
such as (1965) in the name, which is the estimated year of birth (based on a 
published age), to distinguish from someone else. Rarely, two people will have 
the same name but unknown ages or identical ages, in which case we use other 
characteristics such as their title or principal affiliation. As a result, each name 
used is unique within the database, and each person has a unique ID number which 
the database assigned to them.</p>
<p>Secondly, there may be data which was accurate when entered, but has become 
inaccurate as a result of subsequent events or the passage of time. If our 
information is outdated, please tell us and provide updated information.</p>
<h3 id="update">5. Are the data up to date?</h3>
<p>We aim to keep track of changes in directorships of HK-listed companies, 
District Councils, Legislative Council, Executive Council and statutory and 
advisory bodies as announced by the HK Government via press releases or in the 
Gazette. These updates are usually done within a few days of announcement if not 
sooner. Many of the other positions have been entered based on a one-off 
disclosure or review. If you spot outdated information, please help us by 
sending us a link to the new information.</p>
<p>We check the SFC register of licensed persons regularly. We check the 
Companies Registry regularly for changes in the name and status of companies 
incorporated or registered in HK, but we cannot check directorships of 
non-listed companies, as these are hidden behind a pay-wall.</p>
<h3 id="completeness">6. Are the data complete?</h3>
<p>Coverage in Webb-site Database varies depending on the subject. We cover the directors and advisers 
(auditors, bankers, lawyers and so on) of all HK-listed companies since 
1-Jan-1990, including delisted ones. Let us know if you spot errors. For companies not listed in HK, directorship data is not maintained but 
occurs sporadically as we go through HK disclosures, so you will not see the 
entire board of most non-HK-listed companies. We cover members of statutory and 
advisory bodies, since the Gazette went online in May-2000. For some of those 
bodies, we have been able to glean information from online Government press 
releases since 1-Jul-1997. We cover the District Councils since they took over 
from the District Boards in 1999. We cover the Election Committee for Hong 
Kong&#39;s Chief Executive since it was established in 1996. We include data on 
all SFC-licensed entities and their past and present Responsible Officers and 
Representatives since 1-Apr-2003. We include data on all companies registered at 
the Companies Registry since records begin (registration was not compulsory 
until 1911).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="error">7. How do I report an error or outdated information?</h3>
<p>We welcome reports of errors for correction. Just <a href="../contact">click 
here</a> to fill in the form, and please provide as much information as 
possible, including links to any source material.</p>
<h3 id="important">8. I'm an important person in HK. Why am I not in 
Webb-site Database?</h3>
<p>We're sorry we missed you! Please write and <a href="../contact">tell us</a> 
why you think you should be included in the database. We reserve sole discretion to include 
or exclude you. There is no charge for inclusion. We also reserve the right to 
include unimportant people! All information must be verifiable from publicly 
available sources.</p>
<h3 id="importantorg">9. We are an important organisation in HK. Can you 
add us to Webb-site Database?</h3>
<p>Yes. Just
<a href="../contact">send us</a> complete information on the full names and, 
preferably, to reduce mistaken identity, the year of birth of the members of 
your governing body (e.g. board of directors or council), and please keep us 
updated! We reserve the sole discretion to include or exclude your organisation. 
There is no charge for inclusion. All information must be verifiable from publicly available sources.</p>
<h3 id="coreg">10. We are a company registered in HK. Can you remove us 
from Webb-site Database?</h3>
<p>No. We maintain a complete database of every company ever incorporated or 
registered in HK, including its date of incorporation (or for non-HK companies, 
the date of registration in HK), past and present names, type and status, as 
recorded in the HK Companies Registry. These data are public information, and 
when you incorporate or register a company in HK, with the privilege of limited 
liability, you are not entitled to keep the company secret.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">11. Does Webb-site Database breach privacy laws?</h3>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>All of the data in Webb-site Database are previously-published information from public sources, 
including but not limited to listed company annual reports, government and 
company announcements, judgments, gazettes, published birth announcements, obituaries, statutory 
disclosures and information 
reported or appearing in newspapers and other journals. All that we do is bring it all 
together in one easily-accessible database. For more on ID numbers, which are 
just a more accurate version of your name, <a href="../articles/identity.asp">
click here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="deletion">12. Will you delete published information?</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_3.html" target="_blank">Article 
27</a> of the Basic Law, Hong Kong&#39;s constitution, protects freedom of speech, 
of the press and of publication. It is a key element of the rule of law, and one 
of Hong Kong&#39;s greatest assets. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">
First Amendment</a> to the United States Constitution also protects such 
freedoms. You are reading this from our server in the United States.</p>
<p>Our policy is that if information has been legally published and we have 
included it in Webb-site Database, then we will not delete it, 
because that would leave some members of the public (including us) with 
legally-obtained information that others do not have, unless they can find it in 
other sources. The relevance of information to different readers may decay over 
time, but it is not for us to determine the relevance of information to you. So 
for example, we don't delete old directorship records, or shareholding records.</p>
<p>This policy applies even if the source subsequently 
redacts its own archives. It is simply impractical to try to 
reverse the arrow of time and withdraw published information into an 
&quot;unpublished&quot; state, removing it from every repository or database, deleting it from 
human knowledge, or forbidding the repetition of it, whether online or in 
person. We will not create Orwellian
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole" target="_blank">memory holes</a>. It is true that the internet has made published information more 
accessible than ever before. That is not a reason to censor it.</p>
<p>However, if information has been <em>illegally </em>published (for example, 
an illegally-uploaded bank file in a security breach), then unless there is an 
outweighing public interest, we would not include it in our database or report 
it in the 
first place. Examples of an outweighing public interest include, but are not 
limited to, situations in which the information exposes wrong-doing or conflicts 
of interest. Examples might include a corruption payment, or a hidden 
related-party interest in a corporate transaction.</p>
<h3 id="where">13. Where is Webb-site Database published?</h3>
<p>You are accessing Webb-site Database on a server in New York State, USA, and it is 
accessible in all good countries and territories via the internet. We normally edit the 
database from Hong Kong, but we could just as easily do so from many other 
places, and our <a href="https://webb-site.com/webbmail/username.asp" target="_blank">volunteer editors</a> in some 
sections of the database are probably all over the world, similar to Wikipedia.</p>
<h3 id="ratings">14. What are Webb-site Governance Ratings and Webb-site Trust 
Ratings?</h3>
<p>Webb-site Governance Ratings represent the average of the latest rating 
contributed by logged-in Webb-site users over the last year and not withdrawn. 
If the user does not update the rating within 1 year, then it will no longer be 
counted in the average. A user can change or withdraw her rating for any 
organisation at any time, thereby affecting the average over time. Ratings are 
intended to be absolute, not relative to any peer group, and not related to any 
market valuation of listed securities. Zero is the worst, 5 is the best. A user 
can rate any organisation, including statutory bodies and private companies.</p>
<p>Webb-site Trust Ratings use the same methodology but relate to people, and 
how well users trust this person, again on an absolute scale from 0 to 5. A 
person may of course be very trusted but not necessarily have any skill as an 
officer of a particular organisation. The rating is intended as a measure of 
trust, not competence, although if an incompetent person occupies a position of 
trust then this may to some extent be reflect in user opinions.</p>
<p>All Governance and Trust ratings are average user opinions and not facts, and 
do not necessarily represent the opinions of Webb-site.com. No contributing users will be 
identified. Remember that we have no control over our users, and small samples 
of opinions may not be meaningful.</p>
