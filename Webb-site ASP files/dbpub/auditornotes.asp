	<li>The &quot;Removed&quot; date is the date on which the auditor resigned or was 
	replaced, terminated or not re-elected.</li>
	<li>Before 31-Mar-04, HK-listed companies were not required to announce 
	changes of auditors. In some cases the Memorandum &amp; Articles of Association 
	or Bye-laws require the company to call a shareholder meeting to approve the 
	change, in which case the change was public knowledge. In others, the M&amp;A 
	entitle the board to appoint a new auditor without shareholders' approval. 
	So some dates are approximate, as the auditors were only revealed when the 
	accounts were published.</li>
	<li>&quot;U&quot; means unknown date of removal/resignation.</li>
	<li>When a company is first listed, we treat the prospectus date as the date 
	of appointment of all advisers, including auditors.</li>
